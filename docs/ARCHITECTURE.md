```

The plan's Section 0.2 tree is respected, with one deliberate deviation: Python
dependencies are managed with `pip` + `venv` + `requirements.txt` (team
decision), while `pyproject.toml` holds only tool configuration.

## 2. Runtime topology

| Service | Image / build | Host port | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `db` | `pgvector/pgvector:pg16` | 5432 | PostgreSQL 16 with pgvector |
| `redis` | `redis:7-alpine` | 6379 | Celery broker/result backend |
| `minio` | `pgsty/minio:RELEASE.2026-08-04T00-00-00Z` | 9000 / 9001 | S3-compatible object storage |
| `api` | `backend/Dockerfile` | 8000 | FastAPI; runs migrations then Uvicorn |
| `worker` | `backend/Dockerfile` | – | Celery worker |
| `web` | `frontend/Dockerfile` | 3000 | Next.js production server |

The API waits for healthy `db`, `redis`, and `minio`. The web app waits for a
healthy API. `make smoke` asserts every service is healthy within 120 seconds.

> **MinIO image note:** MinIO's official images were removed from Docker Hub
> (`minio/minio` now returns 404) and `quay.io/minio/minio` requires
> authentication. Compose uses the PIGSTY mirror, pinned to a release tag. If
> the mirror becomes unavailable, swap the tag for another MinIO mirror or a
> different S3-compatible server; the application only depends on the S3 API.

## 3. Configuration

`app/core/config.py` defines a single Pydantic Settings model. Values are read
from environment variables and, for local development, the repository-root
`.env` (`.env.example` is the canonical template).

Rules:

- `USE_MOCK_<PROVIDER>=true` selects the in-process mock adapter. Mocks are the
  default for every provider: email, WhatsApp, calendar, LLM, speech, storage.
- The `*_PROVIDER` values name the real adapter used when its mock flag is
  disabled. Real credentials are only required when the corresponding mock flag
  is false.
- In `ENV=production`, startup fails if `JWT_SECRET` is missing or still a
  placeholder, or if a real provider is selected without credentials.
- Secrets are never committed. `.env` is ignored by Git; `.env.example` holds
  placeholders only.

## 4. Health and readiness

- `GET /healthz` — liveness. Always returns `200` with `{"status": "ok"}`.
- `GET /readyz` — readiness. Pings PostgreSQL (`SELECT 1`) and Redis (`PING`)
  with a 2-second budget and returns `200` when both succeed, otherwise `503`
  with per-dependency booleans.

Both endpoints are excluded from the OpenAPI schema.

## 5. Logging and PII

Logging is structured JSON on stdout. Every record includes a timestamp, level,
logger, message, and (when inside a request) a `request_id`. A request ID is
accepted from `X-Request-ID` when it matches `[A-Za-z0-9_-]{1,128}`, otherwise
generated, and is returned in the response header.

`PIIMaskingFilter` is installed on the root handler and rewrites every record:

| Data | Output |
| --- | --- |
| `rahul.sharma@gmail.com` | `r***@gmail.com` |
| `+91 98765 43210` | `98XXXX3210` |
| sensitive fields (`transcript`, `notes`, `content`, …) | `[REDACTED]` |

Masking also applies to free text containing emails or phone numbers. Dates and
short numeric runs are not treated as phone numbers.

## 6. Database migrations

Alembic runs against the async SQLAlchemy engine. The first migration (`0001`)
enables the `vector`, `btree_gist`, and `pgcrypto` extensions and is reversible.
Migrations are the only way schema changes are applied; the API container runs
`alembic upgrade head` before starting.

## 7. Testing

| Layer | Location | Requirements |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Unit | `backend/tests/unit` | No infrastructure |
| Integration | `backend/tests/integration` | PostgreSQL and Redis |
| Frontend unit | `frontend/tests` | Node only |

Integration tests auto-skip when PostgreSQL or Redis is unreachable, so the
unit suite runs anywhere. CI provides both services and therefore runs every
test. The first migration test upgrades, downgrades, and re-upgrades the schema.

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs backend lint/type-check/tests against
`pgvector/pgvector:pg16` and Redis service containers, frontend
lint/type-check/tests/build, and Docker image builds.

## 8. Milestone M0 decisions

- Python 3.12, dependencies pinned in `requirements*.txt`.
- `pip` + `venv` (with `make install-backend`) rather than Poetry/uv lockfiles.
- npm for the frontend; Vitest + Testing Library for unit tests (Playwright
  arrives with the first end-to-end flow).
- Provider enums are generic (`mock`, `openai`, `anthropic`, `ses`,
  `sendgrid`, …); no vendor SDK is committed yet.
- shadcn/ui, TanStack Query, React Hook Form, and Zod are intentionally not
  installed until a milestone needs them.
